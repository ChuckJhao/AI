## *Basics Of Neural Network*

### Assigment_1

* Build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula.
  
### Assignment_mnist
 
* Handwriting digits 0 through 9, Use your own image.
 
### BasicNN
 
### HorseOrHumanLesson 3 - Notebook

  * This code will allow you to choose 1 or more files from your file system, it will then upload them, and run them through the model, giving an indication of whether the object is a horse or a human.
  
### RNNBasic

  * Project: Iris, Train_test_split, Standardization (z-score), Normaliaztion, MinMaxScaler, Normalization.
   
### KNN

* Preparing the Data, Preprocessing, Train Test Split, Feature Scaling, Training and Predictions, Evaluating the Algorithm, Comparing Error Rate with the K Value.

### K-means

* Genearte sample data, K-means algorithm, Plot Scatter, Number of iterations run, Make a circle Dataset, Manually set centroid, Apply K-means with re-scaled data.
  
### Logistic Regression

* LogisticRegression

  * Import Iris data set, Feature scaling, Standardization, Train, Calculation verification, Visualize training data classification results, Calculate the number of misclassified test data, Output prediction probability.
  
* Logistic_multiclass decision regions

  * Import Iris data set, decision_regions for test data, getting the confusion matrix, seaborn pairplot.
  
* Logistic_multiclass

  * Import Iris data set, decision_regions for test data, decision_regions for training data, getting the confusion matrix. 
  
### Decision Tree and Random Forest

* Decision Tree

    * Train, Classifier, Use entropy as a criterion, Calculation accuracy, Test report, Decision tree visualization, Visualize the decision boundary of the decision tree.
    
* Random Forest

    * Calculate the score, Use RandomForest to find out the main features of Iris data classification, AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) Algorithm.
  
### Regression
